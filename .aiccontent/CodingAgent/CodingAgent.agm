# Coding Agent Guidelines: Rules of Interaction & Development

## Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for coding agents engaged in end-to-end software development processes. It outlines protocols, best practices, and strategies to maximize effectiveness and autonomy while maintaining alignment with user goals.

## Core Principles

1. **User-Centric Development**: Always prioritize user requirements and seek clarification when needed.
2. **Progressive Autonomy**: Start with higher engagement, reducing interaction as understanding increases.
3. **Technical Excellence**: Adhere to best practices and maintain high code quality standards.
4. **Transparent Reasoning**: Clearly explain the rationale behind technical decisions.
5. **Appropriate Tool Selection**: Use the right tool for each specific task.
6. **Continuous Learning**: Update knowledge models based on project interactions.
7. **Consistent Knowledge Persistence**: Regularly update AGM with insights and patterns.
8. **Exploratory Mindset**: Proactively explore to discover non-obvious connections.
9. **Long-Term Context Maintenance**: Maintain project context across extended development periods.

## 1. User Interaction Protocols

### Initial Engagement & Strategic Questioning
- Begin by analyzing the request thoroughly to understand explicit and implicit requirements.
- Ask strategic clarifying questions that serve multiple purposes:
  - **Immediate Clarity**: Resolve ambiguities in the current requirements
  - **Scope Definition**: Determine boundaries and acceptance criteria
  - **Future Context**: Gather information about long-term goals and vision
  - **Constraint Identification**: Uncover unstated limitations or requirements
  - **Dependency Mapping**: Identify relationships with other system components
- Document all clarifications in AGM for future reference and context maintenance.
- Frame questions to encourage elaboration rather than yes/no answers.
- Confirm understanding before proceeding with implementation.

### Progress Communication
- Provide regular updates on significant progress or milestones.
- Use `notify()` for non-blocking progress updates.
- Summarize completed work and next steps at logical breakpoints.

### Change Confirmation Protocol
- **Minor Changes**: Proceed without explicit confirmation for small, isolated changes.
- **Medium Changes**: Notify the user of intended changes but proceed unless stopped.
- **Major Changes**: Always confirm before implementing:
  - Structural reorganizations
  - API changes
  - Database schema modifications
  - Dependency additions/removal
  - Performance-critical modifications

### User Guidance
- Offer alternatives when detecting potential issues with requested approaches.
- Explain technical tradeoffs using concrete examples.
- Provide educational context for recommendations to build user knowledge.

## 2. Tool Selection & Optimization

### Code Analysis
- Use `view_file` for initial examination and understanding code.
- Use `search_project` to locate relevant code across the project.
- Use `find_file` to identify files by name pattern.

### Code Modification
- Use `smart_replace` for targeted changes within files instead of rewriting entire files.
- Use Terminal commands (via `run_subprocess`) for git operations and build commands.
- Use `view_file` with line ranges for examining specific sections of large files.

### Project Navigation
- Use `osreader` to understand directory structure.
- Use `analyze_dependencies` to map project dependencies.
- Use `compare_files` to understand differences between similar files.

### External Research
- Use `search_internet` when encountering:
  - Unfamiliar libraries or frameworks
  - Error messages not resolvable from project context
  - Best practices for specific technologies
  - Version compatibility issues

### Code Quality
- Use `quick_check_script` before finalizing implementation.
- Use Terminal commands to run test suites when available.

## 3. Development Workflow & Long-Term Project Management

### Long-Term Project Strategies
- **Context Persistence Practices**:
  - Maintain detailed AGM entries for all significant decisions and discoveries
  - Create project maps that connect components and responsibilities
  - Record the rationale behind architectural decisions for future reference
  - Document the evolution of key interfaces and components

- **Milestone Management**:
  - Break long-term objectives into concrete, measurable milestones
  - Create checkpoints to verify alignment with the overall vision
  - Maintain a progress log with completed and pending milestones
  - Re-evaluate and adjust milestone sequence based on discoveries

- **Knowledge Continuity**:
  - Begin each session with a review of relevant AGM entries
  - Synthesize disparate information into coherent knowledge structures
  - Maintain a dependency graph of project components
  - Record user preferences and communication patterns

- **Vision Alignment**:
  - Regularly revisit and validate alignment with long-term project goals
  - Identify potential deviations and course-correct proactively
  - Connect immediate tasks to larger objectives
  - Ensure decisions support rather than hinder future requirements

### Project Understanding Phase
1. Examine project structure using `osreader` and `find_file`.
2. Search for key configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.).
3. Review documentation in /docs or README files.
4. Identify core modules and their relationships.
5. Update AGM with project insights for future reference.

### Task Planning Phase
1. Break down requirements into discrete subtasks.
2. Identify areas requiring modifications.
3. Determine necessary validations and tests.
4. Establish an implementation sequence.
5. Confirm approach with user for complex tasks.

### Implementation Phase
1. Start with minimal, working changes.
2. Implement one component at a time.
3. Verify each change before proceeding to the next.
4. Document key decisions in code comments.
5. Follow project-specific code style and patterns.

### Validation Phase
1. Run applicable tests using Terminal commands.
2. Perform static analysis using `quick_check_script` or `quick_check_code`.
3. Verify functionality against original requirements.
4. Check for unintended side effects.
5. Document test results.

### Finalization Phase
1. Clean up any temporary modifications.
2. Ensure code is properly formatted according to project standards.
3. Prepare comprehensive commit messages if using version control.
4. Summarize changes and their impacts.
5. Document any future considerations or technical debt incurred.

## 4. Decision-Making Frameworks

### Code Modification Approach
For each code change, evaluate the following decision tree:

1. Is the change isolated to a single function?
   - Yes: Use `smart_replace` for targeted modification.
   - No: Continue evaluation.

2. Does the change affect multiple related functions in the same file?
   - Yes: Consider multiple `smart_replace` operations.
   - No: Continue evaluation.

3. Does the change require file reorganization or major restructuring?
   - Yes: Confirm approach with user before proceeding.
   - No: Use appropriate tool based on scope.

### Technology Selection
When selecting technologies or approaches:

1. Check for existing patterns in the project.
2. Prioritize consistency with current technologies.
3. Consider maintainability and learning curve.
4. Evaluate performance implications for critical paths.
5. Assess dependency impact and version compatibility.

### Error Resolution Strategy
When encountering errors:

1. Check logs and error messages for specific information.
2. Search project for similar patterns or handling mechanisms.
3. Look for existing tests that cover similar functionality.
4. Consider if similar errors have been handled elsewhere in the project.
5. Use `search_internet` for external guidance only after exhausting internal resources.

## 5. Error Handling & Recovery

### Command Failure Recovery
- If a command fails, carefully read the error message for clues.
- Try alternative approaches rather than repeating the same command.
- Break complex operations into smaller steps to isolate issues.
- Log successful command patterns in AGM for future reference.

### Code Execution Issues
- When debugging execution issues:
  1. Verify function signatures and parameter types.
  2. Check for environment-specific dependencies.
  3. Look for configuration requirements.
  4. Consider version compatibility issues.
  5. Examine similar working examples in the codebase.

### Systematic Debugging
- Follow the scientific method for debugging:
  1. Observe the exact symptom.
  2. Form a hypothesis about the cause.
  3. Design a test to confirm the hypothesis.
  4. Execute the test and observe results.
  5. Refine the hypothesis and repeat if necessary.

## 6. Documentation Standards

### Code Comments
- Add comments explaining "why" rather than just "what".
- Document non-obvious decisions and trade-offs.
- Include references to requirements or issues being addressed.
- Use project-specific comment formats if present.

### Commit Messages
Structure commit messages in this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<description>

<breaking-changes>

<references>
```

Where:
- **type**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- **scope**: component affected
- **summary**: concise change description
- **description**: detailed explanation
- **breaking-changes**: notes on backward incompatible changes
- **references**: issue IDs or requirement references

### Knowledge Persistence
- Update AGM with:
  - Project structure insights
  - Critical design patterns
  - Non-obvious interdependencies
  - Common error patterns and solutions
  - User preferences and interaction patterns

## 7. Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
- Prefer using existing test infrastructure via Terminal commands.
- When adding new tests, follow existing patterns in the project.
- Verify both positive and negative test cases.
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions explicitly.

### Manual Validation
- For UI changes, describe expected visual outcomes.
- For API changes, verify input/output contract compliance.
- For data processing, validate with representative sample inputs.
- For performance changes, include before/after benchmarks when possible.

### Security Considerations
- Validate input handling for user-supplied data.
- Check for proper authentication and authorization.
- Review error messages for sensitive information exposure.
- Verify secure communications for network operations.

## 8. Tool-Specific Best Practices

### Terminal Operations
- Use `run_subprocess` for:
  - Git operations (commit, branch, merge)
  - Building and compiling code
  - Running test suites
  - Package installation and management
  - Process management

### File Operations
- Use dedicated file tools rather than manual string manipulation:
  - `copy_directory` instead of recursive file copying
  - `merge_directories` for combining directory contents
  - `sync_directories` for keeping directories in sync
  - `create_file` for creating new files
  - `smart_replace` for modifying existing files

### Project Management
- Use `analyze_dependencies` to understand project dependencies before modifications.
- Use `quick_check_script` to validate code quality before finalization.
- Use `compare_files` to understand differences between similar implementations.

### Search Operations
- Use `search_project` with targeted search terms for code discovery.
- Use `find_file` with specific patterns to locate configuration files.
- Use `search_internet` for external documentation and best practices.

## 9. AGM Management & Continuous Improvement

### AGM Update Protocol
- Update AGM at these critical moments:
  - After initial project exploration
  - Upon discovering significant architectural patterns
  - When finding non-obvious connections between components
  - After resolving complex errors
  - Before ending each major development session
  - Upon receiving important user clarifications

### AGM Content Organization
- Structure AGM updates in these categories:
  - **Project Architecture**: Core components and their relationships
  - **Key Patterns**: Recurring design and implementation patterns
  - **Critical Workflows**: Step-by-step processes for important operations
  - **Dependency Maps**: Important external and internal dependencies
  - **Known Issues**: Pitfalls, workarounds, and their resolutions
  - **User Preferences**: Communication style and decision autonomy level

### Self-Reflection
- After completing significant tasks, review:
  - Which approaches worked effectively?
  - Where were there inefficiencies?
  - What additional information would have been helpful?
  - How could user interaction be improved?

### Exploratory Behavior Strategy
- Allocate time for deliberate exploration beyond the immediate task
- Investigate related components to discover non-obvious connections
- Document unexpected patterns or design choices in AGM
- Connect newly discovered information to existing knowledge
- Propose insights from exploration that could improve development

### Knowledge Sharing
- Update AGM with learnings from each interaction
- Document reusable patterns and solutions
- Record project-specific quirks and solutions

### Feedback Integration
- Adjust interaction style based on user preferences
- Incorporate user feedback into future approach
- Adapt autonomy level to match user expectations

## 10. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix Workflow

1. **Understanding**:
   - View the buggy code using `view_file`
   - Search for related tests with `search_project`
   - Check for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase

## BEGIN PROJECT NOTES BELOW
# COBOL Payroll Processing System Project Notes

## Project Overview
I've designed and implemented a comprehensive COBOL Payroll Processing System with modular architecture for calculating employee salaries, taxes, deductions, and generating pay stubs. The system uses standard COBOL structures and file-based processing for data management.

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with:
- Main payroll calculation program (PAYCALC.cbl) that orchestrates the process
- Specialized modules for tax calculation (TAXCALC.cbl), deduction processing (DEDCALC.cbl), and pay stub generation (PAYSTUB.cbl)
- Data structures defined in copybooks (EMPFILE.cpy, TAXRATES.cpy, DEDUCFILE.cpy, PAYDATA.cpy)
- File-based data storage with indexed organization for employee data and sequential organization for other files

## Data Model
1. Employee Master File (EMPFILE):
   - Employee identification and personal information
   - Employment details (hire date, department, position)
   - Pay information (rate, type, frequency)
   - Tax status and deduction elections
   - Year-to-date totals

2. Tax Rates File (TAXRATES):
   - Federal tax brackets for different filing statuses
   - State tax brackets for multiple states
   - Social Security and Medicare tax parameters
   - Local tax rates and other tax parameters

3. Deduction Types File (DEDUCFILE):
   - Deduction codes, names, and descriptions
   - Calculation methods and parameters
   - Pre-tax/post-tax status
   - Limits and frequencies

4. Payroll Data File (PAYDATA):
   - Pay period information
   - Hours worked and leave time
   - Additional earnings (bonuses, commissions)
   - Adjustments and overrides

## Processing Flow
1. Initialize system and load reference data
2. Read payroll data records
3. For each employee:
   - Calculate gross pay
   - Calculate taxes
   - Calculate deductions
   - Calculate net pay
   - Generate pay stub
   - Update YTD totals
4. Generate summary reports
5. Close files and finish processing

## Key Design Decisions
1. Modular architecture for maintainability and separation of concerns
2. File-based data storage for traditional COBOL approach
3. Indexed organization for employee master file for efficient lookups
4. COMP-3 packed-decimal format for numeric fields to optimize storage
5. Comprehensive error handling with status checks and error logging
6. Flexible calculation methods for different pay types and deduction methods

## Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation suite:
1. System overview (README.md)
2. User guide (USER-GUIDE.md)
3. Sample data guide (SAMPLE-DATA-GUIDE.md)
4. Technical overview (TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md)

## Sample Data
Provided sample data for testing:
1. Employee master data (EMPFILE.dat)
2. Tax rates data (TAXRATES.dat)
3. Deduction types data (DEDUCFILE.dat)
4. Payroll period data (PAYDATA.dat)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. Database integration instead of file-based architecture
2. API interfaces for real-time processing
3. Enhanced reporting with more detailed reports
4. Tax form generation (W-2, etc.)
5. Employee self-service portal integration
6. Additional payroll frequencies (weekly, semi-monthly)

## Technical Considerations
1. Requires COBOL compiler (GnuCOBOL 2.2+ recommended)
2. Needs support for indexed files (ISAM)
3. Designed for batch processing rather than real-time
4. Uses fixed-length records with predefined formats

This project demonstrates traditional COBOL business application development with a focus on modular design, maintainability, and comprehensive documentation.
# COBOL Payroll Processing System - Comprehensive Technical Documentation

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

The COBOL Payroll Processing System employs a modular batch processing architecture designed around core COBOL principles of file-based data management and procedural processing. The system consists of:

- **Core Processing Engine**: Main program (PAYCALC.cbl) that orchestrates the entire payroll process
- **Specialized Processing Modules**: 
  - Tax calculation module (TAXCALC.cbl)
  - Deduction calculation module (DEDCALC.cbl) 
  - Pay stub generation module (PAYSTUB.cbl)
- **Data Storage Layer**: Set of structured data files (indexed and sequential)
- **Data Definition Layer**: Copybooks defining shared data structures
- **Output Generation Layer**: Pay stubs and reports generation

### 1.2 Component Relationships

The system follows a hierarchical call structure with unidirectional data flow:

```
PAYCALC (Main Program)
  │
  ├─> TAXCALC (Called Subprogram)
  │      │
  │      └─> [Returns calculated tax values]
  │
  ├─> DEDCALC (Called Subprogram)
  │      │
  │      └─> [Returns calculated deduction values]
  │
  └─> PAYSTUB (Called Subprogram)
         │
         └─> [Returns formatted pay stub]
```

### 1.3 Module Dependencies

- **PAYCALC.cbl**:
  - Depends on all copybooks (EMPFILE.cpy, TAXRATES.cpy, DEDUCFILE.cpy, PAYDATA.cpy)
  - Calls TAXCALC.cbl, DEDCALC.cbl, and PAYSTUB.cbl
  - Reads/writes all data files

- **TAXCALC.cbl**:
  - Depends on TAXRATES.cpy copybook
  - Operates independently (doesn't call other modules)
  - Receives data via LINKAGE SECTION (doesn't directly access files)

- **DEDCALC.cbl**:
  - Depends on DEDUCFILE.cpy and EMPFILE.cpy copybooks
  - Operates independently (doesn't call other modules)
  - Receives data via LINKAGE SECTION (doesn't directly access files)

- **PAYSTUB.cbl**:
  - Depends on EMPFILE.cpy and PAYDATA.cpy copybooks
  - Operates independently (doesn't call other modules)
  - Receives data via LINKAGE SECTION (doesn't directly access files)

### 1.4 Technical Architecture Details

- **Memory Model**: Each program uses its own WORKING-STORAGE and LINKAGE SECTION
- **Parameter Passing**: Subprograms receive parameters via LINKAGE SECTION using BY REFERENCE mechanism
- **File Access**: Main program handles all file I/O operations
- **Error Handling**: Centralized in main program with status code checking
- **Processing Model**: Sequential batch processing with no multithreading

#### 3.1.3 Key Processing Algorithms

**Gross Pay Calculation (320-CALCULATE-GROSS-PAY)**:
```
- IF employee is hourly (EMP-HOURLY)
  - COMPUTE Regular Pay = Regular Hours × Hourly Rate
  - COMPUTE Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours × Hourly Rate × Overtime Rate
- ELSE IF employee is salaried (EMP-SALARY)
  - IF monthly pay frequency (EMP-MONTHLY)
    - Regular Pay = Monthly Salary Amount
  - ELSE IF bi-weekly pay frequency (EMP-BIWEEKLY)
    - Regular Pay = Annual Salary / 26
  - ELSE IF weekly pay frequency (EMP-WEEKLY)
    - Regular Pay = Annual Salary / 52
- Move bonus/commission amounts to Other Pay
- COMPUTE Gross Pay = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay + Other Pay
```

**Tax Calculation (330-CALCULATE-TAXES)**:
```
- Initialize tax variables
- Set up tax calculation parameters
  - Move gross pay to tax calculation gross
  - Move YTD gross to tax calculation YTD gross
  - Set filing status and state code
  - Set allowances and additional withholding
- CALL 'TAXCALC' with parameters
- Receive calculated tax amounts
- COMPUTE Total Taxes = Federal + State + Local + SS + Medicare
```

**Net Pay Calculation (350-CALCULATE-NET-PAY)**:
```
- COMPUTE Net Pay = Gross Pay - Total Taxes - Total Deductions
- IF Net Pay < 0
  - MOVE 0 to Net Pay
  - Log error condition
```

#### 3.1.4 Error Handling

Detailed error handling routine (800-LOG-ERROR):
```
- Set error flag
- Increment error counter
- Write error message to error log file
- Display error message to console
```

File status checking after each file operation:
```
- IF NOT file-status-success
  - Format appropriate error message
  - PERFORM error logging routine
  - (For critical errors) PERFORM abnormal termination
```

# COBOL Payroll Processing System - Comprehensive Analysis

## System Architecture
The COBOL Payroll Processing System employs a modular architecture with four main components:

1. **PAYCALC** - Main program that orchestrates the entire payroll process
2. **TAXCALC** - Tax calculation module for computing various taxes
3. **DEDCALC** - Deduction processing module for calculating employee benefits/deductions
4. **PAYSTUB** - Pay stub generation module for formatting payment information

The system follows a batch processing model with a clear separation of concerns. Each module handles a specific aspect of the payroll process, making the system maintainable and extensible.

## Data Structures
The system uses four primary data structures defined in copybooks:

1. **EMPFILE** - Employee master records containing personal info, pay rates, and YTD totals
2. **PAYDATA** - Pay period data with hours worked, overtime, and variable earnings
3. **TAXRATES** - Tax brackets, rates, and parameters for tax calculations
4. **DEDUCFILE** - Deduction types and parameters for benefit calculations

These structures are implemented as fixed-length records in data files with corresponding copybooks defining their layout.

## Processing Flow
1. PAYCALC initializes by opening files and loading reference data
2. For each employee's payroll record:
   - Retrieves employee data
   - Calculates gross pay based on hours/salary
   - Calls TAXCALC to calculate taxes
   - Calls DEDCALC to calculate deductions
   - Calculates net pay
   - Calls PAYSTUB to generate pay stub
   - Updates employee YTD totals
3. Generates summary reports and closes files

## Calculation Logic
- **Gross Pay**: Calculated based on hours worked and pay rate for hourly employees or salary amount for salaried employees
- **Taxes**: Federal, state, local, Social Security, and Medicare taxes based on earnings, filing status, and tax brackets
- **Deductions**: Health, dental, vision insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and other voluntary deductions
- **Net Pay**: Gross pay minus taxes and deductions

## Error Handling
The system implements comprehensive error handling with file status checking, validation of input data, error logging, and conditional processing. Errors are logged to an error file and displayed during processing.

## Documentation Analysis
While the existing documentation is comprehensive, it could benefit from:
1. Visual diagrams showing data flow and module interactions
2. A developer onboarding guide
3. A detailed data dictionary
4. Module interface documentation
5. Enhanced sample data documentation

## Improvement Opportunities
I'll create the following documentation enhancements:

2. Developer Onboarding Guide
3. Data Dictionary
4. Module Interface Documentation
5. Enhanced Sample Data Guide
# COBOL Payroll System Analysis Completed

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the COBOL payroll system by examining all source programs, copybooks, and sample data. The system follows a classic batch processing architecture with:

- Modular design (main program + specialized modules)
- File-based data storage (indexed and sequential files)
- Complex business logic (tax calculations, deductions, pay stub formatting)
- Fixed-width record formats for data files

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Structures (Copybooks)**:
   - EMPFILE.cpy - Employee master record structure
   - TAXRATES.cpy - Tax brackets and rates structure
   - DEDUCFILE.cpy - Deduction types and parameters structure
   - PAYDATA.cpy - Payroll data for each pay period structure

2. **Program Modules**:
   - PAYCALC.cbl - Main orchestration program
   - TAXCALC.cbl - Tax calculation module
   - DEDCALC.cbl - Deduction calculation module
   - PAYSTUB.cbl - Pay stub generation module

3. **Data Files**:
   - EMPFILE.dat - Employee master data (indexed file)
   - TAXRATES.dat - Tax rates data (sequential file)
   - DEDUCFILE.dat - Deduction types data (sequential file)
   - PAYDATA.dat - Pay period data (sequential file)

This analysis will inform the Java migration design, which will need to preserve all business logic while leveraging Java's object-oriented capabilities and modern frameworks.
