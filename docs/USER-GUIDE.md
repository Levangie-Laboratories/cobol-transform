## Introduction

The COBOL Payroll Processing System is a comprehensive solution for calculating employee salaries, taxes, deductions, and generating pay stubs. This guide provides detailed instructions for installing, configuring, operating, and maintaining the system.

The system handles all aspects of payroll processing, including:

- Employee data management
- Salary and hourly wage calculations
- Tax calculations (federal, state, local, Social Security, Medicare)
- Deduction processing (health insurance, retirement plans, etc.)
- Pay stub generation
- Payroll reporting

This guide is intended for payroll administrators, system operators, and IT staff responsible for maintaining the payroll system.

2. Prepare data for government filings (e.g., 941 forms).

3. Perform quarterly reconciliation to verify tax totals.

### Annual Procedures

1. Update tax tables for the new year:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll/data
   cp TAXRATES.YYYY TAXRATES  # Replace YYYY with the new year
   ```

2. Generate W-2 forms and annual summaries:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   ./bin/annual_w2_process
   ```

3. Reset year-to-date totals in employee master file:
   ```
   ./bin/reset_ytd_totals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### File Status Errors

- **Status 35**: File not found - Check file paths and names
- **Status 39**: Record size mismatch - Verify file definitions match
- **Status 47**: File open error - Check file permissions

#### Calculation Errors

- **Negative Net Pay**: Check for excessive deductions or incorrect hours
- **Tax Calculation Errors**: Verify tax rates and employee filing status
- **Missing Deductions**: Confirm employee deduction elections

#### Program Errors

- **Abnormal Termination**: Check ERRORLOG for details
- **Module Load Failure**: Verify all modules are compiled and available
- **Memory Errors**: Ensure system has adequate resources

### Error Log Analysis

1. Review the error log file:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   less output/ERRORLOG
   ```

2. Look for specific error codes and messages.

3. Consult the error code reference in the technical documentation.

### Recovery Procedures

1. Restore from backup if data corruption occurs:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   ./bin/restore_data
   ```

2. Reprocess the current pay period after fixing issues:
   ```
   ./PAYCALC
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Processing Bi-Weekly Payroll

1. Prepare the payroll data file with hours worked for the period.

2. Run the payroll calculation:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   ./PAYCALC
   ```

2. Run the add employee utility:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   ./bin/add_employee
   ```

3. Enter the employee details as prompted.

4. Verify the new employee record:
   ```
   ./bin/view_employee [employee_id]
   ```

### Example 3: Year-End Processing

1. Process the final pay period of the year.

2. Generate W-2 forms:
   ```
   cd /opt/payroll
   ./bin/annual_w2_process
   ```

3. Reset year-to-date totals for the new year:
   ```
   ./bin/reset_ytd_totals
