- **System Assessment**: Analyze the current COBOL system and documentation
- **Environment Setup**: Prepare the Java development and testing environments
- **Team Training**: Train team members on the new Java system architecture
- **Migration Planning**: Create detailed migration plan with timeline and responsibilities

### Phase 2: Development and Testing

- **Initial Development**: Complete the Java implementation of all system components
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components for functional equivalence
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions and system workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark the Java system against the COBOL system

### Phase 3: Data Migration

- **Data Mapping**: Finalize mapping between COBOL data structures and Java entities
- **Migration Tools**: Develop and test data migration tools
- **Trial Migration**: Perform trial data migrations with validation
- **Data Cleanup**: Identify and resolve data quality issues

### Phase 4: Parallel Running

- **System Setup**: Configure the Java system for parallel operation
- **Process Alignment**: Align business processes for dual system operation
- **Parallel Execution**: Run both systems in parallel for at least 2 pay cycles
- **Result Comparison**: Compare outputs and resolve discrepancies

### Phase 5: Cutover

- **Final Preparation**: Complete final system checks and verifications
- **Data Migration**: Perform final data migration and validation
- **System Activation**: Activate the Java system as the primary system
- **Legacy Decommissioning**: Begin phased decommissioning of the COBOL system

### Phase 6: Post-Migration Support

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor the new system performance and issues
- **User Support**: Provide enhanced support for users during transition
- **Issue Resolution**: Address any emergent issues promptly
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize system based on production usage patterns

## Detailed Migration Procedures

### Data Migration Process

The data migration process converts COBOL data files to the Java/database format using these steps:

1. **Extract**: Export data from the COBOL system files
   - EMPFILE.dat (Employee master data)
   - TAXRATES.dat (Tax rates and brackets)
   - DEDUCFILE.dat (Deduction types and parameters)
   - PAYDATA.dat (Pay period data)

2. **Transform**: Convert data using migration utilities
   - Map COBOL data fields to Java entity attributes
   - Convert data types and formats
   - Validate data integrity and constraints
   - Generate SQL or JPA entities

3. **Load**: Import data into the Java system database
   - Use DataMigrationService to handle the process
   - Maintain relationships and referential integrity
   - Validate imported data counts and integrity

#### Data Migration Command Example

```java
// Example code to run the data migration
DataMigrationService migrationService = context.getBean(DataMigrationService.class);

// Migrate all data at once
MigrationResult result = migrationService.migrateAllData("/path/to/cobol/data");
System.out.println("Migration complete: " + result);

// Or migrate individual data types
migrationService.migrateEmployees("/path/to/cobol/data/EMPFILE.dat");
migrationService.migrateTaxRates("/path/to/cobol/data/TAXRATES.dat");
migrationService.migrateDeductionTypes("/path/to/cobol/data/DEDUCFILE.dat");
migrationService.migratePayrollData("/path/to/cobol/data/PAYDATA.dat");
```

### Validation Procedures

Validation is critical to ensure the Java system produces the same results as the COBOL system:

#### Data Validation

- **Record Counts**: Ensure all records are migrated correctly
   ```sql
   -- Example validation query
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
   -- Compare with COBOL record count
   ```

- **Field Validation**: Verify key fields match between systems
   ```java
   // Example validation code
   List<Employee> employees = employeeRepository.findAll();
   for (Employee employee : employees) {
       // Compare with COBOL data
       verifyEmployeeData(employee, cobolEmployee);
   }
   ```

- **Data Integrity**: Verify relationships and constraints
   ```sql
   -- Example integrity check
   SELECT employee_id FROM payroll_data
   WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employees);
   -- Should return no rows
   ```

#### Functional Validation

- **Calculation Comparison**: Compare calculation results between systems
   ```java
   // Example comparison code
   BigDecimal javaFederalTax = taxCalculationService.calculateFederalTax(...);
   BigDecimal cobolFederalTax = getCobolFederalTax(...);
   assertEquals(cobolFederalTax, javaFederalTax);
   ```

- **Process Validation**: Verify end-to-end business processes
   ```java
   // Example process validation
   PayrollSummary javaSummary = payrollService.processPayroll(startDate, endDate);
   PayrollSummary cobolSummary = getCobolPayrollSummary(startDate, endDate);
   comparePayrollSummaries(javaSummary, cobolSummary);
   ```

- **Output Comparison**: Compare system outputs (reports, pay stubs)
   ```java
   // Example output comparison
   String javaReport = payrollService.generatePayrollReport(...);
   String cobolReport = getCobolPayrollReport(...);
   compareReports(javaReport, cobolReport);
   ```

### Parallel Running

During parallel running, both systems operate simultaneously to verify equivalence:

1. **Setup**:
   - Configure both systems to process the same pay periods
   - Establish data synchronization procedures
   - Create comparison reports and tools

2. **Execution**:
   - Process payroll in the COBOL system (normal production)
   - Process the same payroll in the Java system (verification environment)
   - Apply the same inputs and changes to both systems

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare gross pay calculations
   - Compare tax withholdings
   - Compare deduction amounts
   - Compare net pay amounts
   - Investigate and resolve discrepancies

4. **Verification**:
   - Document comparison results
   - Address any systematic differences
   - Repeat for multiple pay cycles until satisfied

### Cutover Plan

The cutover plan details the transition from the COBOL system to the Java system:

1. **Pre-Cutover Tasks**:
   - Complete final parallel run and verification
   - Finalize data migration scripts and procedures
   - Prepare rollback procedures
   - Notify all stakeholders of cutover schedule

2. **Cutover Window**:
   - Freeze changes to the COBOL system
   - Perform final data migration
   - Validate data in the Java system
   - Redirect system interfaces to the Java system
   - Verify system access and functionality

3. **Post-Cutover Verification**:
   - Verify all interfaces are functioning correctly
   - Verify user access and permissions
   - Process sample transactions to verify functionality
   - Monitor system performance and errors

4. **Rollback Procedures**:
   - Criteria for rollback decision
   - Steps to reactivate the COBOL system
   - Data restoration procedures
   - Communication plan for rollback scenario

## Common Migration Issues and Solutions
